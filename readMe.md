# Movie Recommendation System

In this project we are comparing two approaches for movie recommendation for a new user or existing user based on their age, gender and occupation.

We have implemented all the methods from scratch and tried to improve the existing movie recommender system.

# Approach 1: SVD-Collaborative Filtering

# Approach 2: k-clique method
